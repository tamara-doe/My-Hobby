        Dance is a performing art form consisting of sequences of movement,
        either improvised or purposefully selected. This movement has aesthetic
        and often symbolic value.[nb 1] Dance can be categorized and described
        by its choreography, by its repertoire of movements, or by its
        historical period or place of origin.
